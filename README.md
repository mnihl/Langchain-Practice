# Langchain-Practice
Practice code files from the online courses surrounding Langchain, the python library that permits Retrieval Augmented Generation.

RAG (retrieval augmented generation) in my own words involves loading documents of any type, splitting them up into semantic chunks, you then embed them (numerically quantify their meanings for comparing similarities), vector store them, retrieve the vectors (via NLP model or whatever) by parsing your query into search terms and filters. This is all for the purpose of answering a user's prompt accurately and diversely by a LLM chatbot.
